# What makes a great engineer?

There's a simple explanation for why great software engineers should be paid more than most other professions. It's because a great software engineer can learn about a business and create code which will generate value or revenue worth many multiples of their salary. A great software engineer is able to leverage their time to have an outsized impact, both on the delivery of services to the customer and on enabling those around them to work faster and with more enjoyment. A great software developer is more than a person though, engineering mastery is the result of a perfect symbiosis between the engineer and the company.

Every great engineer I've met over my career has been an incredibly creative person. And it's obvious that creativity is the heart of any great business. A great engineer can apply their mastery of software development to creatively solve a business' hardest problems. This requires firstly that the engineer has the hard skills to make the software work. It requires secondly that the engineer is sufficiently engaged in the business to care about solving those problems. And thirdly, it requires that the business allow their problems to be solved by engineers. The first two are simple enough to evaluate, it is number three that poses a true challenge to engineers and businesses alike.

The main enabling force which decides whether engineers will be "great" or not lies outside the engineering department. To have great engineers at your company, everyone in it must share a clear belief: "in my company, software engineers are the most capable to solve our hardest problems". That is not to say that the effort is not collaborative â€” on the contrary, collaboration between customer support, sales, marketing, and management is absolutely essential. Also we can imagine a company with no great developers which works just fine. Not everyone needs "great developers" at their company. But if your goal is to become a Software Driven company, that means that the people who make your software must be the leaders within your decision-making framework.

The reasoning here is simple: software has created new ways to solve business problems, with infinite possibilites to transform data, enable communication, and influence processes. But the possibilities are still locked inside the medium of code. It requires someone with a mastery of the medium to tease out the particular solution for your exact problem. Software is a powerful force that has broken all the rules of conventional business. If your business still adheres to those old rules then it doesn't matter how skilled your engineers may be, they will always be only as effective as a plumber or an electrician. You only allow them to solve the problems that everyone already knows the solution to.
